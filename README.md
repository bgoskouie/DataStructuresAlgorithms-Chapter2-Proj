# DataStructuresAlgorithms-Chapter2-Proj

This repo is related to the Udacity Data Structures and Algorithms course.

It contains the solutions to the second chapter's project.
This Project includs six tasks:

- LRU Cache
- Finding Files (within a dictory)
- Hoffman encoding and decoding algorithm (of a sentence or string)
- Active Directory (Find a user in a group)
- Blockchain Linked List
- Linked List: Intersection and Union

The Solution of each of these tasks is in a single .py file under the name of 1-xxx.py.
The Big O analysis can be found within the 1-explanations.md file, 2-explanantion.md, and so on for each task.
